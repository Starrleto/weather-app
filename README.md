Weather App
Create a weather app based on prototype and utilize weather API

Day One: 
1 - Fetched API
2 - Used Geolocation for API on startup
3 - Made structure of website design
4 - Repo made

Day Two:
1 - Functionality of all buttons have been applied
2 - Days of week are displayed but I need to check if they'll fully work tomorrow when the date changes
3 - Layout updates
4 - Current weather is displayed
