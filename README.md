Weather App
Create a weather app based on prototype and utilize weather API

Day One: 
1 - Fetched API
2 - Used Geolocation for API on startup
3 - Made structure of website design
4 - Repo made

Day Two:
1 - Functionality of all buttons have been applied
2 - Days of week are displayed but I need to check if they'll fully work tomorrow when the date changes
3 - Layout updates
4 - Current weather is displayed

Peer review: Kyle Yok Eyh Ma
Review: The sun and moon in the back ground shift in sizes depending on which description is open. The favorties work nicely and the fill of the favorite heart is consitent with the favorite status. It would have been nice to use the country code some where in the website. From a first-eyes glance text sizes seem inconsistent. There are some little spacing for elements but overall its very close to the original.
